## Project Overview

This project utilizes the Blender Python API (`bpy`) to implement procedural content generation techniques. The script focuses on generating 3D meshes, specifically rings and legs, by calculating vertices in 3D space. The content is built programmatically using mathematical formulas to create intricate geometric structures, which can be applied in various 3D modeling or animation scenarios.

### Key Features:
- Uses **Blender's Python API** (`bpy`) for 3D content generation.
- Generates **rings** and **legs** through procedural algorithms based on trigonometric calculations.
- Supports customization of parameters such as radius and the number of vertices to control the complexity of the mesh.

### Future Improvements:
1. **Additional Geometric Shapes**: Extend the project to include other geometric forms, such as cubes, spheres, or more complex shapes.
2. **Texture and Material Generation**: Add functionality for procedural texture and material generation to complement the geometry.
3. **Animation Support**: Implement procedural animation techniques to bring the generated models to life.
4. **User Interface Enhancements**: Develop a Blender add-on with a user-friendly interface for easier control over generation parameters.
5. **Optimization for Performance**: Improve the script's efficiency when handling larger or more complex 3D scenes.
